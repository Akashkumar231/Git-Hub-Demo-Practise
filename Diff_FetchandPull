Fetching 

 Fetching allows us to download changes from a remote repository, But those changes will

 not be automatically integrated into our working files.


 It lets you see what others have been working on, without having to merge those changes 
 into your local repo.

 Think of it as "please go and get the latest information from Github , but don't screw up
 my working directory".


 Pulling 

 git pull is another command we can use to retrieve changes from a remote repository. Unlike fetch, pull actually
  updaes our Updates our Head Branch with whatever changes are retrieved from the remote.

 "go and download data from Github And immediately update my local repo with those changes"
